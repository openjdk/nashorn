Nashorn Engine
==============

Nashorn engine is an open source implementation of the 
[ECMAScript Edition 5.1 Language Specification](https://es5.github.io). 
It also implements many new features introduced in ECMAScript 6 
including template strings; `let`, `const`, and block scope; iterators 
and `for..of` loops; `Map`, `Set`, `WeakMap`, and `WeakSet` data types; 
symbols; and binary and octal literals. It is written in Java and runs 
on the Java Virtual Machine.

Nashorn used to be part of the JDK until Java 14. This project provides
a standalone version of Nashorn suitable for use with Java 15 and later.

Nashorn is free software, licensed under 
[GPL v2 with the Classpath exception](https://github.com/openjdk/nashorn/blob/master/LICENSE), 
just like the JDK. 

Documentation
=============
Making Nashorn standalone is still a work in progress. There is no 
standalone documentation for it yet. The best current documentation are 
Nashorn-related documents published by Oracle with Java 14:

  * [Nashorn User's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/nashorn/)
  * [Java Scripting Programmer's Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/scripting/index.html)
  * [Nashorn API Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/jdk.scripting.nashorn/module-summary.html)

Getting Started
===============
What you see in this repository at the moment is the initial state after
extracting Nashorn source code from the JDK. As such, it can not yet be
cleanly built, and binaries are not yet available. Therefore you can 
unfortunately not get started on the standalone Nashorn just yet. Both 
of these will change soon, and we will replace this notice then.
